# Meme-Complex-Calculator
I think it checks convergence of some complex number equation. Probably. This script was made a while before I got around to uploading it, so I honestly have no idea what I intended to use it for. My best guess is someone posted some dumb math equation in a discord server somewhere and I think I was trial-and-error checking if it converges at certain values?
